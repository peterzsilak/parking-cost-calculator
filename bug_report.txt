Scenario Outline: Long-Term Garage Parking                                  # src/test/resources/features/long-term_garage_parking.feature:21
    Given the parking cost calculator system                                  # ParkingSteps.the_parking_cost_calculator_system()
    When the user selects the "Long-Garage" rate                              # ParkingSteps.the_user_selects_the_rate(String)
    And the user starts the parking at "10/18/2019" and "8:00" and sets "AM"  # ParkingSteps.the_user_starts_the_parking_at_and_and_sets(String,String,String)
    And the user closes the parking at "10/18/2019" and "14:01" and sets "AM" # ParkingSteps.the_user_closes_the_parking_at_and_and_sets(String,String,String)
    Then the system estimates the "$ 12.00" ticket price                      # ParkingSteps.the_system_estimates_the_ticket_price(String)
      java.lang.AssertionError:
Expected: is "$ 12.00"
     but: was "$ 14.00"
